\subsection{Why Plagiarism Occurs?}
\begin{frame}{Why Plagiarism Occurs?}
	Two Potential Reasons:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Conscious Avoidance:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Creating false citation.
			\item Use original content as it was with citation.
			\item Paraphrased properly in own words without citation.
		\end{itemize}
		\smallskip
		\item Unconscious Negligence:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item I know so everyone knows.
			\item Forget to acknowledge or cite.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\textit{\textbf{\color{blue} Notes:}} \\
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Self-plagarism and text recycling might be taken as plagiarism.
	\item Falsification and fabrications are also research misconducts.

\subsection{How to Avoid Plagiarism?}
\begin{frame}{How to Avoid Plagiarism?}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Summarize, paraphrase, and cite.
	\smallskip
	\item Contact original idea/work generator and seek approval if needed.
	\smallskip
	\item Clearly and unambiguously differentiate your ideas/works from others.
	\smallskip
	\item Use {\color{gray}\textbf {common knowledge (?)}}.
	\smallskip
	\item Plagiarism Dilemma: \textbf{revise, rewrite,} and \textbf{cite}.	
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Common Knowledge:}
\begin{frame}{What are \textquotedblleft Common Knowledge\textquotedblright?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Depends upon writer, reader, knowledge level, situation, events, consequence, relative field of work, etc.
		\smallskip
		\item Universal truth such as \textquotedblleft Sun rises from East.\textquotedblright
		\smallskip
		\item \textquotedblleft Alfred Marshall's Principle of Economics developed a supply-and-demand curve\textquotedblright \textbf{MAY BE} a common knowledge for \textbf{economics student} but \textbf{NOT} for \textbf{Palentobiology student}.
		\smallskip
		\item Find frequently used but uncited information (common knowledge) in established literature in your field and context.

\subsection{Actions to Reduce Plagiarism:}
\begin{frame}{Actions to Reduce Plagiarism:}
	\begin{itemize}				
		\item National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) can subpoena if plagiarism is suspected {\color{blue}\href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31324124/}{(Kornfeld, 2019)}}.
		\smallskip
		\item NSF Grant recipient faculties (88\%) were twice more likely to be guilty of research misconduct to that from National Institute of Health (NIH) (42\%) {\color{blue}\href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31324124/}{(Kornfeld, 2019)}}.
		\smallskip		
		\item Five {\color{blue}\href{https://oig.nsf.gov/investigations/research-misconduct/by-the-numbers}{NSF}} grant recipients, out of 15 concluded investigations, were guilty of plagiarism from October 2021 to September 2022.
